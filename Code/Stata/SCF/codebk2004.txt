WARNING: This codebook contains over 100,000 lines of text, including
this introduction, variable descriptions, the source code for the
computer program used to collect the survey data, and other material.
Most users will probably NOT want to print the entire document.
Generally, we recommend working with the material in a text editor
using a non-proportional font for display.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The codebook serves as the principal guide to the variables
included on the final public version (February 20, 2006 version) of the
2004 SCF data set.  However, not every variable included in this
codebook is actually in the public use data set.  Among other things,
the data set does NOT include most variables related to the sample
design, details of geography, or the 3-digit industry and occupation
codes.  Although we have attempted to mark the variables in the
codebook that are not available to the public, there may be errors and
omissions.  The definitive list of the variables included is given at
the end of this file.  Please consult that list to determine whether a
given variable is available to you.

The SCF is sponsored by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System in cooperation with the Statistics of Income Division of the
Internal Revenue Service.  Data for the 2004 SCF were collected by the
NORC, a nation organization for research and computing at the
University of Chicago (NORC).

For a general overview of the 2004 SCF, see Brian K. Bucks, Arthur
B. Kennickell, and Kevin B. Moore "Recent Changes in U.S. Family
Finances: Evidence from the 2001 and 2004 Survey of Consumer
Finances," Federal Reserve Bulletin, www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/
2005/05index.htm, winter 2006.  Results you may obtain from using this
release of the 2004 SCF data may differ from those reported in this
article for several reasons.  First, the analysis weights used in that
article were altered to provide robust estimates of the detailed
categories shown.  In brief, the data were examined for extreme
outliers, and where a given case was overly influential in determining
an outcome, the weight was trimmed and other weights were inflated to
maintain a constant population.  Second, as noted below, the public
version of the data has been systematically altered to minimize the
likelihood that unusual individual cases could be identified.  Our
analysis of the public data set suggests that these changes should not
alter the conclusions of reasonable analyses of the data.  Finally,
over time we correct errors that we find in the data set.  In our past
experience, the effects of such errors on the estimates have been
quite small.

This codebook is intended to provide only an overview of the most
critical technical elements of the survey.  For more details, see

Finances: Methodology and Directions for Future Research," May 2000,

DATA FILES INCLUDED ON SCF WEB SITE FOR THIS RELEASE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary data files for the survey consist of the following elements:
(1) the main data set, (2) a file of replicate weights corresponding to
X42001 (see below for a description of the replicate weights), and (3)
an aggregated version of the main data set containing summary
variables corresponding to those used in "Recent Changes in
U.S. Family Finances: Evidence from the 2001 and 2004 Survey of
Consumer Finances" (Brian K. Bucks, Arthur B. Kennickell, and Kevin
B. Moore, Federal Reserve Bulletin, 2006).  The data are provided in a
variety of formats.  To aid users in reconciling their calculations
with those found in the 2006 Bulletin article, two sets of tables
comparable to those in the article are provided: the first set is
based on the current internal version of the data, and the second
version is based on the current public version of the data.  Finally,
in the Excel version of the aggregated data file, a table-making
utility is provided for users who wish to make customized calculations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTIONNAIRE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2004 SCF was collected using computer-assisted personal
interviewing (CAPI).  Thus, there is no questionnaire in the usual
sense.  This codebook serves as the most comprehensive guide to the
definitions of variables included in the survey.  Later in this
file, copies of the Surveycraft (SC) programs that were used to collect
the data are included.  The SC programs serve as the authoritative
reference for questions relating to question ordering and skip
sequences.  Because question ordering is important in understanding
the meaning of many questions, users of the data are encouraged to
consult the SC program.  After the SC program, a translation of most
SC variables into SCF variables is provided.  Although there
is usually a direct correspondence between the SC variables and the
final variables listed in this codebook, there are some places where
the connections are indirect: In some cases, the same question is
asked in two difference places, and in the final data set all instances
of answers to the question are mapped into a single location; in other
cases variables may be inferred from other information (for example,
if a respondent reported a wage on a current job and reported that
their employer contributed a certain percent of their wage to a
pension plan, then the dollar contribution to the plan would be filled
in).  Almost always, the data rearrangements can be identified from
the shadow variables associated with the variables (see section
"VARIABLE NAMES" below).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNIT OF ANALYSIS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the data in the survey are intended to represent the financial
characteristics of a subset of the household unit referred to as the
"primary economic unit" (PEU).  In brief, the PEU consists of an
economically dominant single individual or couple (married or living
as partners) in a household and all other individuals in the household
who are financially interdependent with that individual or couple.  For
example, in the case of a household composed of a married couple who
own their home, a minor child, a dependent adult child, and a
financially independent parent of one of the members of the couple,
the PEU would be the couple and the two children.  Summary information
is collected at the end of the interview for all household members who
are not included in the PEU.  The only variables collected separately
for the respondent and the spouse or partner of the respondent are
those concerning employment, pension, and demographic characteristics.
Throughout the codebook, we refer to the "head" of the household.  The
use of this term is euphemistic and merely reflects the systematic way
in which the data set has been organized.  The head is taken to be the
single core individual in a PEU without a core couple.  In a PEU with
a central couple, the head is taken to be either the male in a
mixed-sex couple or the older individual in the case of a same-sex
couple.  No judgment about the internal organization of the households
is implied by this organization of the data.  When the original
respondent was someone other than the person determined to be the head
in this sense, all data (including response codes) for the two members
of the couple were systematically swapped. The variable X8000
indicates which cases have been subjected to such rearrangement.

NOTE: Because only limited information is collected on the
ownership of assets and liabilities within the PEU, it is not
possible, in general, to make direct separate estimates of the
financial characteristics of the individuals in the survey
households unless one is prepared to make a number of fairly complex
assumptions.  To understand this point more thoroughly, there is no
substitute for a careful reading of the actual survey questions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAMPLE DESIGN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SCF is based on a dual-frame sample design.  One set of the survey
cases was selected from a standard multi-stage area-probability
design.  This part of the sample, which contributed 3,007 cases to the
final set of interviews, is intended to provide good coverage of
characteristics, such as home ownership, that are broadly distributed
in the population.  The other set of the survey cases was selected as
a list sample from statistical records (the Individual Reserach Tax File)
derived from tax data by the Statistics of Income Division of the
Internal Revenue Service (SOI).  These records were made available
under strict rules governing confidentiality, the rights of potential
respondents to refuse participation in the survey, and the types of
information that can be made available.  This second sample was
designed to disproportionately select families that were likely to be
relatively wealthy (see "Modeling Wealth with Multiple Observations of
Income: Redesign of the Sample for the 2001 Survey of Consumer
Finances," Arthur B. Kennickell, October 2001,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html for a more
extended discussion of the design of the list sample).  The list
sample contributed 1,515 cases to the final set of interviews.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODEBOOK CONVENTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For many purposes it is useful to know which responses were available
to the interviewer and which were actually known by the respondent.
Responses that are noted in the codeframes below by an asterisk are
ones that were available to the interviewer on the screen during the
interview.  In general, if a response is given in the codebook in
lower case letters, this indicates that it was permissible for the
interviewer to read it to the respondent.  Responses listed in all
upper case letters are ones that were not intended to be read to the
respondent.  Codes that result from the recoding of responses
originally reported as "other" are also given in lower case letters.
Other subsidiary question texts given in capital letters are intended
as interviewer instructions.

In some cases, codes were available conditional on responses to
earlier questions.  One such example that appears throughout the
interview is the reporting of institutions where the respondent has
accounts of some type.  If the respondent reported fewer than seven
financial institution at X305, every time the interviewer came to a
question that asked about the institution where the respondent had an
account, the screen displayed the names of the already listed
institutions (referred to as "Institution 1" etc. in the codebook), a
code for "add an institution," and a code to enter to record an
unusual type of institution ("not a financial institution"). Once seven
institutions had been recorded (either at X305 or by adding
institutions later in the interview), the screen displayed the names
of the six institutions, the "not a financial institution" field,  and
a set of codes for the type of institution (i.e., commercial bank,
savings and loan or savings bank, credit union, etc.).

For many questions there are multiple versions.  Most commonly, there
are variants that are appropriate for single individuals and ones
appropriate for families of two or more.  Some other variants are more
complicated.  For example, suppose that a respondent lives in a
building with multiple housing units (X702=1), the family owns the
entire building (X714=1), and they own the unit they live in
separately from the rest of the building.  The CAPI program stores the
information that there is such a property.  Later in the interview
when the respondent is asked about the number of investment real
estate and vacation properties, one variant of question X1701 reminds
the respondent to include the property mentioned earlier.  There are
many other such instances where the computer alters questions to
suit the previous answers given by the respondent, and this codebook
attempts to provide at least a summary form of all the possible
questions.  For example, at X1711 (correspondingly at X1811 and
X1911), the respondent is asked whether there are any outstanding
loans on a property.  If the respondent had previously reported at
X1703 (correspondingly at X1803 and X1903) that the property was a
time-share, then the variant for time-shares is asked; otherwise a
more generic question is asked.

Telephone interviewing has long been important in the SCF, but it was
particularly so for the 2004 survey; 44.7 percent of all interviews
were completed by telephone.  At the beginning of the interview, the
interviewer entered a response to X7578 to indicate the mode of the
interview.  Because the normal visual cues, such as show cards, are
not usually available to respondents for telephone interviews, the
question text needed to be altered, generally in simple ways.
Throughout the codebook, alternative versions of questions used in
telphone interviews have been flagged.

Of the 4,522 interviews, 155 were conducted in Spanish.  The Spanish
text is not provided in the main section of the codebook, but the
interested user may consult the SC program for the Spanish version of
the instrument, which is provided later in the codebook.

The authoritative references for deterimining how the information was
presented to the respondent are the executable CAPI program, which is
available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/2004/
scf2004home.html, and the text of the computer program program used by
interviewers to collect the data; the text of this program is appended
to this codebook.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLE NAMES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The codebook refers to the variables by the names they have in the
version of the survey data set formatted for use with SAS.  These names
consist of a number prefixed by an "X."  We have tried, insofar as it
was possible, to retain the variable numbering system used in earlier
SCFs.  Where the content of a variable has changed in a substantive
way, we have assigned a new variable number.  Since the 2001 SCF,
the following variables were added: 1) variables associated with the
newly added 7th financial institution  X332, X6656-X6663, X6894-X6897,
X334 2) X7138, X7580, X9258, X1226, X7023-X7034, X3024-X3030, X3726
3) variables associated with the new savings grid beginning with X3727
(see variable defintions below) 4) X6551-X6574, X6756-X6758, X7785, X7787,
X6575-X6593, X6595-X6599, X6900-X6905, X6933-X6999, X8467-X8472, X7004
5) variables associated with the new current job pension grid
beginning with X11001 (see variable defintions below) 6) variables
associated with the newly added 6th cash settlement X5818-X5822.
Variables dropped since 2001 include: 1) X7130, X2103, X2110, X2204,
X2304, X2404, X7151 2) variables associated with the "old" money
market grid, the "old" savings grid, and the old current job pension
grid and 3) X6445, X6449, X6453, X3610, X3620, X3630, X3631, X6816-X6820,
X6826, X6831-X6835, X6841, X6463, X6468, X6473, X6478, X6483, X6488,
X6804, X6805, X8455, X8456, X6491-X6496, X6807, X6808, X8458, X8459,
X7666, X7667.

Each of the variables in the main data set has a "shadow" variable that
describes--in almost all cases--the original state of the variable
(i.e., whether it was missing for some reason, a range response was
given, etc.).  The most important exception is reported values which
have been imputed or otherwise altered to protect the privacy of
respondents (see "DISCLOSURE REVIEW" below).  Users who so desire may
use the shadow variables to restore the data to something very close
to their original condition. The shadow variables have the same
numbers as the main variable, but have a prefix of "J."  A list of the
values taken by the shadow variables is given in the section below
entitled "DISCUSSION OF RANGE DATA COLLECTION AND J-CODES."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL DATA CONVENTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Throughout the SCF data set, a value of zero has only one meaning: that
the item in question is inapplicable.  That is, if a family does not
have a checking account, then the number of checking accounts they own
would be coded as a zero.  Whenever zero is a legitimate response to a
question, a value of -1 is used to signify that value.  Other
specialized codes are defined for specific variables in the codebook.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE ID NUMBERS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the original case numbering system (XX1), important aspects of
the sample design are apparent from the identification numbers.  Because
such information is not releasable under the agreements which allow us
to collect the data, each case included in the public version of the
data set has been given a random identification number (YY1).  Users
should note that it is not possible to know with certainty from the
information provided in the public version of this data set which cases
derive from the list sample.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"OTHER" CODES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In almost every case where a respondent could supply a response that
did not fit in the codeframe offered to interviewers on their computer
screens, the CAPI program was constructed to allow the entry of a
verbatim response.  There were a few open-ended questions that were
set up to accept only a verbatim response.  All of these verbatim
responses were run through a standard coding process at NORC.  Once
the data were at the FRB, strenuous efforts were made to resolve all
instances of responses that were unresolved by the NORC coders.
Responses that remain coded "other" in the final data set are unusual,
but legitimate responses which do not fit within the existing
codeframe; because these responses appeared unlikey to reoccur in future
surveys, the codeframe was not augmented.  Responses that were not
informative (or were not answers to the questions that were asked)
were treated as missing values and were imputed.  An identical process
has been followed since the 1995 SCF.  In earlier surveys, the
information recorded for "other" responses was not as complete, and
the efforts to recode the available verbatim data were somewhat less
stringent.  Thus, analysts should exercise caution in time series
comparisons of "other" responses from the 1995 and later surveys with
those in earlier years.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GRIDS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some sets of questions in the SCF have a natural iterative pattern.
For example, the survey asks for detailed information on up to the
first six checking accounts owned by the PEU, and summary information is
collected about all remaining accounts.  The detailed questions are
the same for each account.  In past interviews done with paper and
pencil, some respondents have resisted answering the detailed
questions but have been willing to provide summary information.
Typically, interviewers recorded the summary information in the
margins of the questionniare, and editors allocated the data to the
skipped questions according to a set of fixed rules.  To allow for
a variety of respondent-interviewer interactions in the SCF CAPI
program, the grid questions were organized to provide a way of
collecting summary information in a systematic way.  We refer to the
associated summary variables as "mop-up variables."  Past surveys also
indicated that some respondents recalled additional instances of
items once they began answering questions in a grid, but interviewers
often did not revise the originally reported number.  The CAPI
procedures were set up to allow for this possibility of recalling
additional items.

Consider first a respondent who gives a non-missing response to the
question that asks for the number of items of the type to be queried
in the grid.  The interviewer would ask the respondent the first set
of detailed questions on the item.  Then, the interviewer would be
confronted with a question (not to be read to the respondent);

  INTERVIEWER:  CONTINUE, OR GO TO MOPUP OF LOOP?

The intention of this question was to allow the interviewer to deal
with a potentially hostile respondent and immediately branch to the
mop-up questions.  If the respondent was cooperative, the interviewer
entered a CONTINUE response and followed an identical procedure at
each iteration until either the number of items reported was
exhausted, or the maximum number of detailed questions was asked and
the mop-up question was asked to get summary information on all 
remaining items.  If the respondent reported a number of items less
than the maximum number about which the detailed questions are asked,
the following question was asked at the end of the final iteration:

  Do you (or your family living here) have another xxxx?

A YES response here indicates that the respondent recalled an
additional instance in the process of answering the detailed
questions.  A respondent could continue to "add" iterations until the
maximum number of iterations is reached and the mop-up questions are
asked.

Another possibility is that a respondent may either not know (or be
unwilling to tell) the number of instances of an item.  Because it is
known that there is at least one such instance, the first set of
detailed questions is asked.  Then the respondent is asked:

  Do you (or your family living here) have another xxxx?

The questioning then proceedes exactly as it would for a respondent
who recalled additional instances after providing an initial number of
instances.

In processing the data, several steps were taken to attribute the data
collected to their correct location.  First, in some cases interviewers
answered the question "INTERVIEWER:  CONTINUE, OR GO TO MOPUP OF LOOP?"
with the latter response, even though only one more instance remained.
In such cases, the mop-up data were mapped into the appropriate
position in the grid.  This data movement is not directly recorded in
the J-variables for such cases, although the movement can be deduced
from the patterns of J-variables of other questions within the
iteration of the grid that do not have mop-up equivalents: the value
of the J-variables for such variables without mop-up equivalents
would normally be 2052.  Second, when respondents added instances, the
originally reported number was updated and stored in the customary SCF
variable number.  The originally reported number of instances has been
retained in the data set since such information cannot be recovered in
any other way from the data made available.  Third, when summary
information was given by respondents who broke off their responses in
a grid prematurely, that information was used to bound the imputations
of the detailed data.  Data items that have an associated J-variable
with a value of 90 are ones where a complete response was given in the
parallel mop-up variable, and those with a J-variable of 91 are ones
where a range response was given in the parallel mop-up variable.
There are some complicated mixed cases where a respondent gave
a missing value for the number of instances, but was willing to
provide non-missing mop-up data.  Though tedious, it is possible to
deduce this information from the J-variables provided.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY VARIABLES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary variables (e.g., NET WORTH) are not included in the main
data set.  Although it is complicated to construct such variables, it
is our belief that a substantial amount of judgment is involved in
defining variables, and that other analysts should make their own
decisions.  However, as a convenience to users, we have included on
the SCF web site a program written in the SAS language that was used to
create the variables used in the 2006 Federal Reserve Bulletin article
on the survey and an Excel file containing the summary variables.
Users who wish to use the definitions in this program are encouraged
to review the definitions to be certain that classifications are
appropriate for their analytical purposes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATA REVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A very large amount of time has been spent in searching for errors in
the data and resolving those errors.  Many seeming inconsistencies are
actually in the raw data and appear to have no obvious reconciliation.
Our initial presumption is always that the respondent understood each
question and reported accurately, and that the process of
transcription and coding did not distort that information.  In cases
where other information led us beyond a reasonable doubt of the
validity of the data, we have changed data, either by altering values
directly or by setting them to missing and imputing them; in all such
cases, the shadow variables indicate that we have overridden reported
data (for an overview of the extent of data changes, see "Measuring
Data Quality In the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances," Arthur
B. Kennickell, August 1999, http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/
method.html).  We ask our colleagues who use this data set to help us
in finding any remaining resolvable inconsistencies.

The imputations for missing data are subject to hierarchical logical
constraints, but otherwise they reflect the data, whether they be
consistent or inconsistent.  For example, total income (X5729)
in the reported data is sometimes not equal to the sum of the individual
components (X5702 etc.), so this constraint is not automatically
applied to the imputed data.  Variability in the imputations for a
variable in a given case may sometimes be large.  This variation is a
reflection of the fundamental uncertainty about the true value of the
item.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPUTATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the variables that originally contained a missing value code
have been imputed.  The exceptions include such variables as X6695
(which reports the original number of checking accounts reported by
the survey respondent) and X6504 (which is the interviewer's
description of the property where the respondent lives).  The nature
of any originally missing values may be understood by examining the
J-codes associated with the variables.  A multiple imputation
procedure yielding five values for each missing value is used to
approximate the distribution of the missing data.  The individual
imputation are made by drawing repeatedly from an estimate of the
conditional distribution of the data.

The imputations are stored as five successive replicates
("implicates") of each data record.  Thus, the number of observations
in the full data set (22,610) is five times the actual number of
respondents (4,522) (see DISCLOSURE REVIEW below for information on
the public version of the data set).  The imputation procedure is
described in "Multiple Imputation in the Survey of Consumer Finances"
(Arthur B. Kennickell, September 1998, http://www.federalreserve.gov/
pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  For a general discussion of multiple
imputation and its uses, see "Multiple Imputation for Nonresponse in
Surveys" by Donald B. Rubin, John Wiley and Sons, 1987.  Multiple
imputation offers two distinct advantges compared with singly-imputed
data.  First, because multiple imputation yields multiple outcomes
from a random process, it supports more efficient estimation than
singly-imputed data.  Second, multiple imputation allows users to make
straightforward estimates of the degree of uncertainty associated with
the missing information.

For users who want to estimate only simple statistics such as means
and medians ignoring the effects of imputation error on the standard
errors of these estimates, it will probably be sufficient to divide
the weights by 5.  Software to compute means and medians and their
associated standard errors with respect to imputation and sampling
error is provided in the section on sampling error later in this
codebook.

Users who want to estimate more complex statistics, particularly
regressions, should be cautious in their treatment of the implicates.
Many regression packages will treat each of the five implicates as an
independent observation and correspondingly inflate the reported
statistical significance of results.  Users who want to calculate
regression estimates, but who have no immediate use for proper significance
tests, could either average the dependent and independent values
across the implicates or multiply their standard errors by the square
root of five.  For an easily understandable discussion of multiple
imputation in the SCF from a user's point of view, see Catherine
Montalto and Jaimie Sung, "Multiple Imputation in the 1992 Survey of
Consumer Finances," Financial Counseling and Planning, Volume 7, 1996,
pages 133-146 (or on the Internet at http://www.hec.ohio-state.edu/hanna/
imput.htm).  That article also contains a set of simple SAS macros to
use to compute correct standard errors from multiply imputed data.
Two alternatives for processing general model estimates are offered
here, one written in SAS (MACRO MISECOMP) and the other in Stata
(StataMIcode.do).  See the section "ANALYSIS WEIGHTS" below for a
brief discussion of the inclusion of sample design effects in the
estimation of complex statistics.

* MACRO MISECOMP computes standard errors corrected for multiple imputation;
* The input may be regression results, or any other results (e.g.,
  probits) that include a point estimate and a standard error estimate
  for each implicate;
* The data sets are named &DSN.1-&DSN&NIMP (where &DSN and &NIMP are
  defined below);
* The form of the input data set is described above;
* Often, it is quite easy to copy output directly from a statistical
  procedure into the form of this program without deleting extraneous
  information;
* The required input variables are VARN (a name of the statistic of
  interest in all NIMP data sets), B1-B&NIMP (a working name for the
  point estimate of interest for each implicate--where the terminal
  number corresponds to the terminal number of the input data set), and
  S1-S&NIMP (a working name for the standard error of the point
  estimate in each implicate--where the terminal number corresponds to
  the terminal number of the input data set;
* The parameters of the MACRO are:
  NIMP: number of implicates (default is 5)
  DSN: first part of name of each of the NIMP input data sets (e.g.,
  DSN11, DSN12,...,DSN15 could be results for implicates 1-5 for model
  1) (default is DSN1i, where "i" ranges from 1 to NIMP)
  PRNTPR: determines the number of digits of the output data (default
  is SAS format 10.6);
* The output includes three lines for each unique VARN in the
  input data sets: the final point estimate, the final standard error,
  and the final t-statistic;

******************************************************************************;

* Steps to compute standard errors;
* (1) run each model (regressions, probits, etc.) for each of the five
  implicates separately;
* (2) copy the model outputs into program code as described above;
/*
  For example,
  DATA DSNij;
    INPUT VARN $ Bi Si;
    CARDS;
    data here
    ;
  RUN;
  where "i" ranges over the number of distinct models treated, and "j"
  ranges over the number of implicates.
  NOTE: any technique that reads VARN, Bi and Si into the data sets will
  work.
*/
* (3) call MISECOMP (MACRO defaults will work correctly for the SCF if
  the data set names are DSN11, DSN12, DSN13, DSN14, DSN15);

DISCUSSION OF RANGE DATA COLLECTION AND J-CODES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the 1995 SCF, the CAPI program has allowed interviewers a
variety of ways to enter partial information (for a detailed
description and analysis of range data in the 1995 survey, see "Using
Range Techniques with CAPI in the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances,"
Arthur B. Kennickell, January 1997, http://www.federalreserve.gov/
pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  In the past, we had evidence that some
respondents volunteered figures in ranges.  Good interviewers have
always tried to get respondents to settle on a single "best" figure,
but sometimes it may be that there is no firm figure (e.g., the value
of a privately-held business may be known only at the point it is
actually sold) and probing too far could cause the respondent to
answer "don't know" or to refuse to answer.  The CAPI program allows
respondents to report a range of possible value in such cases.  There
is another class of respondents who may not volunteer a range, who do
not know (or will not give) an exact figure, but who will give some
information about the value.  To obtain information from this second
group of people, the CAPI program includes two options. First, a
respondent who is uncomfortable actually saying an amount may report a
letter from a card that specifies a number of ranges.  The range card
has been used very successfully in earlier waves of the SCF, but CAPI
allows the option to be presented consistently.  Second, a respondent
who declines the use of the range card is asked a series of questions
in a "decision tree" that are designed to specify a range.  The dollar
breaks in the decision tree vary by question (so that, for example,
monthly rent is not subject to the same ranges as the value of
corporate stock).  The computer sequences used for range follow-up for
all dollar values in the survey (known as "PROBE$") are outlined
schematically in a section below.  It should be noted that
interviewers were strongly instructed that a single dollar value is
the best answer to each of these questions.  Although there is the
distinct possibility that respondents may become "trained" in the use
of the range questions during the course of the interview (the effect
of this training is unclear at present: respondents may tend to report
"too many" ranges because they know that they are allowed;
alternatively, respondents may learn that it is much quicker to give a
single dollar figure), interviewers should be using all of the
standard techniques to get respondents to give a single figure where
possible.  Evidence from the SCF suggests that this approach
dramatically reduces the frequency of "don't know" responses, but it
has little effect on refusals.  Although the overall proportion of
respondents reporting no information is much lower, generally the
proportion providing complete responses declined.

*++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*;

Schematic diagram of the sequence used for all dollar questions:

                 Qnn.  How much is your [******]?

level 1:  $________  Volunteer a range     Don't know        Refuse
                                               |________________|

level 2:  Confirm    Range card                   Give a range?
                     or dollar range?

                     RC      DR            RC      DR         NO/DK     Refuse

level 3:  OUT        Letter  Upper bound   Letter/Own range   Decision
                             Lower bound                      tree

level 4:             Confirm Confirm       Letter  Own        Confirm   Confirm

level 5:             OUT     OUT           Confirm Confirm    OUT       OUT

level 6:                                   OUT     OUT

(OUT=proceed to next question)

At the first level, the respondent has the option of providing a
dollar amount (interviewers were strongly urged to obtain a single
dollar value where possible), volunteering a range, answering "don't
know," or refusing to answer.  These responses require a variety of
different follow-up questions.  In the case of a single dollar
figure, the CAPI program displays in words the number the interviewer
has typed into the computer and proceeds to the next question.  If the
respondent volunteers a range, there is an option to report either a
range in dollars (in some cases the upper or lower bound of a
range may be missing--e.g., as in the case where a respondent answers
"greater than a million dollars") or to give a letter from a range
card (the ranges are given below).  If the respondent answers "don't
know" or refuses to answer, the program will request a range; if
the respondent agrees, the program will accept the same types of
range that may be volunteered directly from the initial dollar
screen.  If the respondent is unable to provide a range in this way
(that is the respondent answers "no" or "don't know"), the program
presents a series of questions known as a "decision tree," which is
specified in greater detail below.  If the respondent refuses at any
point beyond the initial dollar screen or answers "don't know" at any
point after entering the decision tree, the program proceeds to the
confirmation screen.  The exact question text for this sequence is
given below.

Because of software limitations, negative ranges presented a special
problem.  It was not feasible to build in negative ranges directly.
As a compromise, interviewers were instructed to collect the ranges in
absolute values and record in a comment box available in the program
the fact that the range was negative.

If R volunteers a range at level 1, the following is displayed at
level 2:

     SELECT TYPE OF RANGE:

     ENTER LETTER FROM RANGE CARD
     R WILL GIVE RANGE

  If the range card option is chosen, the screen displays:

     ENTER LETTER FROM RANGE CARD:

  and any of the following letters on the range card may be entered:

               A    ......    $1 - $100
               B    ......    $101 - $500
               C    ......    $501 - $1,000
               D    ......    $1,001 - $2,500
               E    ......    $2,501 - $5,000
               F    ......    $5,001 - $7,500
               G    ......    $7,501 - $10,000
               H    ......    $10,001 - $25,000
               I    ......    $25,001 - $50,000
               J    ......    $50,001 - $75,000
               K    ......    $75,001 - $100,000
               L    ......    $100,001 - $250,000
               M    ......    $250,001 - $500,000
               N    ......    $500,001 - $1 million
               O    ......    $1 million - $5 million
               P    ......    $5 million - $10 million
               Q    ......    $10 million - $25 million
               R    ......    $25 million - $50 million
               S    ......    $50 million - $100 million
               T    ......    More than $100 million


  If R offers to give a dollar range, the screen displays:

     ENTER LOW END OF RANGE :  $___,___,___.__

     ENTER HIGH END OF RANGE : $___,___,___.__

  Whichever type of range is selected, after the range information is
  entered, the program skips to the confirmation screen.

If R answers "don't know" or "refuse" at level 1, the following text
is presented:

     IF IN-PERSON READ:
     Can you give me a range--either your own range or one from the
     range card?

     IF TELEPHONE:
     Can you give me a range?

     YES, OWN RANGE
     YES, RANGE CARD
     NO

  If one of the YES options is chosen, the sequence is as given above
  for directly volunteered ranges.

  If R refuses at this point, the program skips directly to the
  confirmation screen.

  If R answers "no/don't know", level three is a decision tree
  designed to guide the R into a range response where possible.

    In the decision tree, respondents are asked a series of questions
    to bound the true response within an interval.  The intervals are
    defined in terms of seven values; let those values be denoted
    generically by V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7.  The questions asked
    take the following form:

     Q1.  Was it more than V4 dollars, less than V4 dollars, or about
          V4 dollars?

               MORE --> GO TO Q2
               LESS --> GO TO Q5
               SAME, DK, REF --> CONFIRMATION SCREEN

     Q2.  Was it more than V5 dollars, less than V5 dollars, or about
          V5 dollars?

               MORE --> GO TO Q3
               LESS, SAME, DK, REF --> CONFIRMATION SCREEN

     Q3.  Was it more than V6 dollars, less than V6 dollars, or about
          V6 dollars?

               MORE --> GO TO Q4
               LESS, SAME, DK, REF --> CONFIRMATION SCREEN

     Q4.  Was it more than V7 dollars, less than V7 dollars, or about
          V7 dollars?

               MORE, LESS, SAME, DK, REF --> CONFIRMATION SCREEN

     Q5.  Was it more than V1 dollars, less than V1 dollars, or about
          V1 dollars?

               MORE --> GO TO Q6
               LESS, SAME, DK, REF --> CONFIRMATION SCREEN

     Q6.  Was it more than V2 dollars, less than V2 dollars, or about
          V2 dollars?

               MORE --> GO TO Q7
               LESS, SAME, DK, REF --> CONFIRMATION SCREEN

     Q7.  Was it more than V3 dollars, less than V3 dollars, or about
          V3 dollars?

               MORE, LESS, SAME, DK, REF --> CONFIRMATION SCREEN


    To allow for appropriate ranges for all dollar questions, there are
    eight different versions of the V1 to V7 variables given below.

Version     V1     V2       V3       V4         V5         V6          V7
   1     10,000  100,000  250,000  500,000    1,000,000  5,000,000   10,000,000
   2     10      25       50       100        200        300         500
   3     50,000  100,000  150,000  250,000    500,000    1,000,000   5,000,000
   4     5,000   25,000   50,000   100,000    250,000    500,000     1,000,000
   5     5,000   10,000   25,000   50,000     100,000    250,000     750,000
   6     500     1,000    5,000    10,000     25,000     75,000      250,000

    There are 22 possible unique outcomes of each version of each of the 8
    versions of the decision tree:

    1. Q1=NO, Q5=NO
    2. Q1=NO, Q5=DK

    21. Q1=Ref ---> NOTE: RESULTS IN NO BOUNDING INFORMATION
    22. Q1=DK ---> NOTE: RESULTS IN NO BOUNDING INFORMATION

    If R answers "don't know" or "refuse" at any point in the decision
    tree, the program skips to the confirmation screen.

The confirmation screen:

  Where the R has given a complete dollar response the confirmation
  screen displays:

    I would like to confirm that that amount is... (amount in words)

  Where the R has given a a letter from the range card, the confirmation
  screen displays:

    I would like to confirm that is range card letter (letter).

  Where the R enters and completes any questions in the decision tree,
  the confirmation screen displays"
    I would like to confirm that the amount is in a range around...
    (midpoint of a fully bounded range or the endpoint of an
    open-ended range)

  Where the R refuses or answers "don't know" in a way that no range
  information at all is obtained, the confirmation screen indicates to
  the interviewer that no information has been obtained.  Nothing
  on the confirmation screen is read to the R in this case.

  The data entry on the confirmation screen offers the following two
  options:

    THIS IS CORRECT
    GO BACK AND FIX


*++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*;
*++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*;

The shadow variables fall into three large groups.  Codes of less than
90 indicate that data were not originally missing (or that they could
be inferred with high confidence from other information).  Codes
with an integer value from 90 through 996 indicate that the respondent
provided a range response.  The extensive form of the paths through
the range questions encompasses a large number of outcomes, as is
reflected in the number of possible range codes.  For the codes that
indicate a range response, there may also be a decimal component.  A
code with a decimal part equal to 0.5 indicates that the initial
response that the respondent gave to the associated dollar question
was "don't know."  In every other case, there should be no decimal
component to the shadow variable.  Codes of 997 or more indicate that
the associated data value was completely missing.

There is an important exception to the normal assignment of J-codes.
In some cases, it is not known where a reported value should actually
be reported, because a higher-order question was missing.  For
example, if the respondent does not know if a car loan is a regular
installment loan, by default the CAPI program asks a generic question
about the typical payment on the loan; if the loan is a regular
installment loan, the appropriate question would be about regular
payments; in the initial data processing, the payment amount is
inserted into both potential locations and one of them is set to the
code for inapplicable (zero) after the loan types is imputed.  In such
cases, the original J-code for the reported data is retained in all
relevant locations.  As a quality control mechanism, the imputation
software is set up so that it can never alter an original J-code.

Definitions of the "J" Variables (2004 version)

0  = Originally reported value.  See above for an exception.

1  = Question is inapplicable (e.g., R has no checking account
     so value of checking account is coded as zero.)  NOTE: all
     values of zero in the data set are in some sense inapplicable
     [also see J-code value 14]; reported values of zero are
     typically stored as -1.

2  = Data taken from (or moved from) another location (e.g., a
     motorcycle misclassified in the automobile grid moved to the
     other vehicle grid); data moved from another location and added
     to data already at the new location (e.g., wage income from
     spouse reported in independent adult part of the questionnaire
     added to data reported for R in the section on total family
     income); data reported in a "mop-up" field that could be directly
     mapped into the correct final location.  These moves and changes
     may be the result of verbatim responses, interviewer comment, or
     other information.

4  = CAPI program error: resolution yields a non-missing (non-range)
     value.

5  = Indicates a value coded directly by FRB staff from a verbatim
     ("other/specify") response or interviewer comments that
     translate directly into a valid response.  This code indicates
     that there was the exercise of a bare minimum of judgment in
     encoding the content of the text data.  ("Super-no" corrections
     are included here.)
6  = Indicates a value coded directly by NORC from a verbatim
     ("other/specify") response.

8  = variable computed from other non-missing variables.

9  = variable overridden by logically equivalent information to
     maintain consistency of data (e.g., when type of property is a
     time share (X1703=25), but R says they own the share alone
     (X1704=1)--rather than saying that the property is a time share
     (X1704=5)--then the response to X1704 is changed to 5).

10 = This code applies to variables where part of the original value
     reported should have been (or was) also reported elsewhere and is
     edited out here (e.g., in the case where the wage income of NPEU
     member is reported at X6403 and at X5702 along with income of
     the PEU, the NPEU value is removed from X5702 and J5702=10).

11 = Assumption made in CAPI program to guide questions dependent on
     marital history (applies at X107 only): value originally answered
     "don't know" or "refuse".
12 = Assumption made in CAPI program to guide questions dependent on
     marital history (applies at X107 and X7020 only); except code 11.
     Question not directly asked.

13 = Data change in editing; based on information in interviewer
     comments made during or after the interview, data structures
     elsewhere in the interview, data retrieval from interviewers, or
     mechanical review of data patterns.  Judgment is implied in the
     use of this code.
14 = Inapplicable code generated by any data adjustment,
     (particularly adjustments associated with J-codes 2, 10, 13, 15,
     16, and 17).
15 = Non-stochastic imputation of missing data (typically based at
     least in part on other, non-codeable data).
17 = Value of originally missing data item implied by/computed from
     other variable(s).  Relatively more judgement is implied by this
     code than a code 8.

30 = Respondent agreed to provide a dollar range as a response
     (either as a directly volunteered range or in response to the
     question soliciting a range after an intial response or "don't
     know" or "refuse"), but the upper and lower bounds of the range
     given were identical.
31 = Respondent entered the decision tree, but chose one of the
     boundary points of a range as the approximate value.


ALL RESPONSES THAT FOLLOW HAVE AT LEAST SOME MISSING INFORMATION

90 = Bounding information available based on summary information
     provided by respondent (typically, if a R does not know
     information about items beyond a certain number in a set of
     detailed questions about a larger number of such items, the R is
     asked one or a number of summary questions about all remaining
     instances).
91 = Same as 90, but R gave range data for the summary information.


RANGE RESPONSES:

POSITIVE RANGES

DECISION TREE RESPONSES THAT RESULTED IN A BOUND FOR POSITIVE NUMBERS

(NOTE: for decision tree codes, responses that resulted in no usable
bounding information are collected separately below)
'*' indicates an open-ended interval

NOTE: for J-code outcomes from 101-878, 921-940, and 971-990, .5 is
added to the J-code if the original response was DK

OTHER CODES FOR MISSING DATA

2050 = Original response was DK.
2052 = Original response missing as a result of missing information for
     a higher-order question.  For example, if the respondent refused
     to say whether or not the family had a checking account, then the
     number of checking accounts would be missing in this sense.
     In a few circumstances a different procedure is followed: (1) if
     a dollar variable was missing and the answers in PROBE$ yielded a
     missing value that variable has an associated frequency question
     that is only asked when a positive value of the dollar variable
     is reported, then the frequency variable is given the same J-code
     as the dollar variable; (2) for clusters of variables containing
     a dollar amount and percent options (for example, employer match
     rate percentage contribution and dollar amount of contribution to
     a pension plan) that can be computed from each other (perhaps
     given some other variable--in the case of the example, this other
     variable would be the worker's wage).
2053 = Original response was refused
2054 = Original response was "some, DK how many" (see B6).

2056 = Missing value determined from verbatim response by NORC coders.

2060 = Unresolved data problem (none should remain in final data set).

2079 = Data missing because of questionnaire error.
2080 = Recode variable, missing because data not collected for
       sub-group, data to be imputed.
2081 = Recode variable, some, but not all components originally missing.
2082 = Recode variable, all components originally missing.

2097 = Override of reported information with (at least partially)
       imputed data
2098 = Override of reported/inap./other information with a missing value.

2099 = Used for absent spouse for J104 or J105 when X104 or X105 < 0.

3000 = Data missing because R broke off the interview (each of these
       cases reviewed to be sure that sufficient information is
       reported that the case can count as a "partial accepted as
       complete")

3001 = CAPI program error yielding a missing value.

3002 = Temporary value given to variables containing illegal values.
       These will all be resolved in editing and converted to other
       existing codes.  (includes "range U")

3003 = Illegal zero response

3004 = Uninformative/irrelevant verbatim response

3005 = Data not available (applies to data from survey screener)

3500 = Data set to missing and imputed for disclosure avoidance

General instructions for J variable coding for recoded variables:
  When a recoded variable is taken directly from another single
    X-variable, it should have the same J-variable code.
  When a recoded variable may come from a single variable in the
    original X-variables, or as the result of a calculation based on
    some number of X-variables, it is important to distinguish the
    information content in the J-variables.  As noted above, when the
    value is taken directly, the J-variable should have exactly the
    same value as that for the X-variable's shadow J-variable.
    However, when some calculation is involved, this should be
    reflected in the J-variable -- codes 8, 2081, and 2082.
  When a recoded variable cannot be computed because some part of the
  underlying information was not collected for some subset of cases,
  the recoded variable's J-variable should be coded 9 or 2080.

ANALYSIS WEIGHTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because the SCF sample is not an equal-probability design, weights
play a critical role in interpreting the survey data.  The main
data set contains the final nonresponse-adjusted sampling weights.
These weights are intended to compensate for unequal probabilities of
selection in the original design and for unit nonresponse (failure to
obtain an interview).  The weight (X42001) is a partially design-based
weight constructed at the Federal Reserve using original selection
probabilities and frame information along with aggregate control
totals estimated from the Current Population Survey.  This weight is a
relatively minor revision of the consistent weight series (X42000)
maintained for the SCFs beginning with 1989 (For a detailed discussion
of these weights, see "Consistent Weight Design for the 1989, 1992,
and 1995 SCFs and the Distribution of Wealth," by Arthur B. Kennickell
and R. Louise Woodburn, Review of Income and Wealth, Series 45, Number
2, June 1999, pp. 193-215 or the longer version given on the SCF web
site at http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  The
nature of the revisions to the consistent weights is described in
"Revisions to the SCF Weighting Methodology: Accounting for
Race/Ethnicity and Homeownership" (Arthur B. Kennickell, January 1999,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  A version
of the revised weight has been computed for all the surveys beginning
with 1989, and this variable has been added to the public versions of
the SCF data sets.  Users should be aware that the population defined
by the weights for *each implicate* (see above) is 112.1 million
households: the sum of each of the weights over all sample cases and
imputation replicates is equal to five times the number of households
in the sample universe.

Although the weights should produce reliable results at the level of
broad aggregates (e.g., net worth and income ), it is important to
note that many of the variables collected in the SCF are highly
skewed in their distributions and that many such variables will apply
to only a relatively small fraction of the sample; thus, estimates of
characterstics of such variables may be distorted by outliers.  In the
SCF group at the Federal Reserve, we routinely review our calculations
for the presence of overly-influential outliers, and robust techniques
are applied when appropriate.  We encourage other users to exercise
similar care in analyzing the data.

The issue of weighting in regressions has long been controversial.
Users of the SCF may find two references particularly useful:
(1) Analysis of Complex Surveys, C.J. Skinner, D. Holt, and
T.M.F. Smith (editors), John Wiley and Sons, 1989 (see particularly
pages 8-10, 154-157, and 286-287). (2) The Analysis of Household
Surveys: A Microeconometric Approach to Development Policy, Angus
Deaton, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997 (see particularly pages
67-73).  At the least, users should think carefully about the effects
of weights in their particular models.  Weighted estimates may be
dramatically less efficient than unweighted estimates.  If one is
interested in estimating descriptions of the population--rather than
"structural models"--there are some clear justifications for
weighting and making estimtes of sampling error (see below) to test
for statistical significante.  If weights make a substantial
difference in regression estimates, analysts may want to consider the
possibily that their models omit some key structure that could be
controlled for in a way other than weighting.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAMPLING ERROR
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SCF is a designed as a scientific instrument for the measurement
of behavior.  However, even under ideal operational conditions, the
measurements of the survey are limited in a fundamental way by the
fact that it is based on a sample of respondents rather than the
entire population.  Variability of estimates based on sample data can
be estimated.

Because we are unable to release any of the basic sample information
about the cases in the data set, users are unable on their own to
compute reasonable estimates of the sampling variances of their
estimates.  To facilitate such estimation, we provide a file of
replicate weights and multiplicity factors corresponding to X42001.
Using detailed information about the original sample design, we 
selected 999 sample replicates from the final set of completed cases 
in a way intended to capture the important dimensions of sample
variation (for details see "Weighting design for the 1992 Survey 
of Consumer Finances," Arthur Kennickell, Douglas McManus and Louise 
Woodburn, December 1996, http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/
method.html).  For each survey case and each replicate, the file
contains a weight (WT1B1-WT1B999) and the number of times the case 
was selected in the replicate (MM1-MM999).  We computed weights for 
each replicate using exactly the same procedures we used for the main 
weights.  Replicate weights were computed only for the first implicate 
of each case.  For many purposes, users for the replicate weight files 
will probably want to multiply the weight times the multiplicity: in 
all cases the sum of each of the weights times the corresponding 
multiplicities of the cases equals the total number of households.  
To estimate the sampling variance of the mean of family income, for 
example, a user would estimate the mean 999 times using the replicate 
weights and compute the standard error of that estimate.  An estimate 
of the total standard error attributable to imputation and sampling is 
given by SQRT((6/5)*imputation variance + sampling variance).

A simple SAS program to compute the standard error due to sampling and
imputation for the mean and median of a given variable is provided
below.  This program may be adapted easily for other types of
calculations.  For example, to compute the standard error of a
proportion, create a zero/one dummy variable to indicate the presence
of the item; the standard error of the mean will be the correct
standard error of the proportion.  To reduce the computer memory
requirement, the program computes sampling error using blocks of 100
replicate weights rather than the full set at once.  Users with large
amounts of RAM may wish to increase the size of these blocks, and
those with smaller amounts may wish to decrease the size.

    * MACRO MEANIT;
    * AK November 12, 2002;
    * DSN specifies the name of the data set to be used (the data set
      should contain the following: the main weight renamed as WGT0, a
      set of variables WGT1-WGT999 equal to the replicate weights
      multiplied by the multiplicity factors, a variable for which
      one wishes to compute the standard error due to imputation and
      sampling for the mean and median, and a variable IMPLIC equal to
      the implicate number of each case)
      VAR contains the name of the variable for which one desires
      standard errors
      PFLAG: blank prints interim statistics/any character string
      (e.g., NO) surpresses printing
      WHERE: defines subsets of data (use IML conventions, e.g.,
        ((X333=3 | X444=4) & X555=5 & X666^=6);
    * WARNING: this MACRO is not intended to be used with subsets
      of the full survey data where the population total varies
      across subsetted implicates: to use this MACRO to make
      calculations for a subset of the full data set, invoke the WHERE
      statement;
    * NOTE: the calculation excludes observations with missing values
      from the calculation.  Thus, if one wants to make the
      calculation for only non-INAP values, a convenient short cut
      might be to set all such values (normally zero in the main SCF
      database) to a missing value (a WHERE condition would also
      work).  The program assumes that missing value patterns are
      consistent across implicates--if this is not the case, a WHERE
      condition should be used;
    * WARNING: if one uses this MACRO to compute variances for very
      small sub-populations, there is a chance that some of the
      replicates may contain no cases where the condition defining the
      sub-population holds.  In this case, the program will return a
      fatal error;

DISCLOSURE REVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables not included in the public data set are available only to
the project staff working on the SCF.  Not even other researchers at
the Federal Reserve Board are allowed access to the non-public data.
There is no provision whatsoever for allowing direct access to such
information for external researchers.  Occasionally, when a researcher
outside of the SCF project staff has a topic that complements the
research interest of the Federal Reserve Board and when there has been
time for the project staff to engage with the researcher, the project
staff have made limited runs against the internal data of computer
programs that have been specified and fully tested by external
researchers.  A special case must be made for each such instance.
THERE IS NO ROUTINE PROVISION FOR ACCESS TO THE RESTRICED SCF
DATA.

A paramount goal of the survey is to protect the privacy of the
participants, who generously shared their personal information.
In light of this goal, the data in this release have been
systematically altered by several means to minimize the possibility of
identifying any survey respondent.  For some discrete variables, small
or unusual cells were collapsed as noted in the individual variable
descriptions below with the descriptions of the variables.  Continuous
variables were rounded.  Data were also blurred by other means
intentionally not specified.  In addition, a number of other cases
were identified for more extensive treatment.  Some of these cases
were selected on the basis of extreme or unusual data values; other
cases were selected at random.  For each of these cases, a selection
of critical variables was set to missing and statistically imputed
subject to constraints designed to ensure that any distortions induced
in key population statistics would be minimal.  Where relevant, the
codebook provides more detailed information on cell collapsing and
other techniques.

By design, the SCF sample excludes people who are included in the
Forbes Magazine list of the 400 wealthiest people in the U.S. (see
references in "SAMPLE DESIGN" above).  However, there are several
reasons why respondents with wealth at this level could appear in the
sample anyway.  In the 2004 survey, there were 3 observations that
had net worth at least equal to the minumum level needed to qualify
for the Forbes list.  Because it would be very difficult to obscure
sufficiently the identity of such people without rendering their data
virtually useless, it was decided to remove them from the public
version of the datset.  Thus, the public version of the data set
contains 4,519 of the 4,522 observations in the full data set.

It is important to note that aside from the cell collapsing, there is
no key in this codebook or in the data set that would allow users to
identify with certainty either which data items have been smoothed or
otherwise altered, or which cases were selected for imputation of
critical values (that is, the shadow variables in this data set may not
always reflect the true original status of every variable).  Although
this blurring of the data will have some effect on analysis, that
effect should be negligible in most cases.  For further details
on the procedures taken to protect the identity of respondents, see
"Analyzing the Disclosure Review Procedures for the 1995 Survey of
Consumer Finances," Gerhard Fries, Barry W. Johnson, and R. Louise
Woodburn, September 1997, http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/
oss2/method.html) and "Multiple Imputation and Disclosure Protection:
The Case of the 1995 SCF" (Arthur B. Kennickell, November 1997,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  The
disclosure protections applied to the data are the product of an
agreement between the Federal Reserve Board, NORC, and SOI.  Users who
feel that the restrictions imposed on the public data set are too
constaining are encouraged to submit written proposals for expanded
data release, and those requests will be given serious consideration
in the release of data from future surveys.

Note that dollar variables in the public data set have been rounded
according to the following scheme which preserves the population mean
on average:

COMPARISON WITH OTHER DATA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, medians of financial characteristics estimated from the
SCF should compare well with medians estimated from other surveys
using comparable population definitions.  However, estimates of means
will often differ, largely for two reasons.  First, means of many
financial characteristics may not be very robustly estimated in
surveys that interview only a relatively small number of wealthy
households.  The distribution of many financial characteristics (e.g.,
net worth) is highly skewed, and sparce representation of the upper
tail will translate into a noisy estimate of statistics, such as the
mean, that are strongly affected by the top of the distribution.
Second, there may also be a degree of bias in the measurement of some
financial characteristics.  Evidence suggests that there is
differentially higher nonresponse among wealthy households.  Failure
to account for such differences in the creation of analysis weights
leads to a misrepresentation of the size of the upper tail of wealth
and characterstics associated with being in that tail.  By using frame
data for the list sample, the SCF has the means to identify and make
some corrections for such nonresponse.  However, this option is not
available in most other surveys.

The SCF may also be compared with aggregate statistics, such as the
flow of funds accounts (FFA), which are constructed by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  An extensive analysis of the
differences in these two sources is provided by Rochelle Antoniewicz
("A Comparison of the Household Sector from the Flow of Funds Accounts
and the Survey of Consumer Finances," October 2000, http://www.
federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html).  As discussed in that
paper in detail, there are many conceptual differences between the SCF
and the FFA.  Three of these differences are particularly noteworthy
here.  First, the FFA "household sector" includes the holdings of
nonprofits, and estimates of those holdings must be made to create a
population basis closer to that used in the SCF.  Second, the
financial concepts used in the FFA often differ from those used in the
SCF.  Substantial effort is usually required to align the concepts in
the two sources, and in some cases there is no clear way of doing so.
Third, both the FFA and the SCF provide statistical estimates.
Because the two series are developed from independent sources of
information with different statistical properties, it would be
surprising if they yielded precisely the same totals even if the
populations and concepts could be made perfectly consistent.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The SCF is a large project that involves intense commitment by many
people.  At the Federal Reserve, the main project staff involved with
the creation of the data included Ryan Bledsoe, Brian Bucks,
Gerhard Fries, Arthur Kennickell, Kevin Moore, Michael Neal, Brian
Preslopsky, and Brooke Wells.  Important support has come from the FRB
officer corps, particulary Edward Ettin, Diana Hancock and Myron Kwast
who have invested their credibility in making the project possible.
Individual members of the Board of Governors have actively encouraged
the development and use of the survey.  Support from the Statistics of
Income Division at the IRS has been essential.  Barry Johnson has been
tireless in his work to obtain the necessary data for the selection of
the list sample, in his work on the disclosure review, and in sharing
the insights he has gained in working with the IRS estate tax data.
Nicholas Greenia, the confidentiality officer for SOI, and Michael
Strudler were particularly helpful in securing the necessary data and
documentation.  Thomas Petska, the director of SOI, and James Nunns at
the Office of Tax Analysis at the Department of the Treasury have
encouraged and supported us through many difficult periods.

At NORC, very many people have touched the project in important ways.
Leslie Athey was the Project Director.  Fritz Scheuren served as NORC
corporate liaison to the SCF.  Craig Coelen, Nancy Potok and John
Thompson also provided key corporate oversight.  Angela Abbott, Azure
Addison, Christine Carr, Dennis Dew, Sarah Hughes and Mandy Sha played
important roles in the development of materials for the project and in
the support of data collection.  Statistical support was provided by
Steven Pedlow and Fritz Scheuren.  Data processing support was
provided by Haider Baig, Val Cooke, Brian Homan, Sarah Hughes, Sharon
Hurn, Katie O'Shea, Mandy Sha and Geoff Walker.  Val Cooke revised the
CAPI program for the project, building on earlier versions of the
program developed by herself, Geoff Walker and Phil Panzuck.
Renee Grigorian served as the graphic designer for a new refusal
conversion package developed for the survey.  The principal Central
Office training staff for the project included Azure Addison, Ron
Broach, Dennis Dew, Sarah Hughes, Ajay Sagar, Micah Sjoblom and John
Sokolowski.  Coding of respondents' verbatim responses was provided by
Sarah Hughes and Nauman Mirza.  Logistical support was provided by
Albert Bard.  Financial management was the responsibility of Antonio
Macias.  Catherine Haggerty and Bob Bailey, who were leading figures
in the 1998 SCF, served as consultants in early stages of the design
of the 2004 survey.  Serious efforts were undertaken to increase the
quality of the data collected in the SCF; among others, Angela Banner,
Lynn Gallagher, Sally Harrison, Elizabeth Loudermilk, Chuck Losasso
and Sandy Pitzer played important parts.

Field operations are the heart of survey research.  Suzanne Bard,
Judith Petty and Charlene Weiss were the NORC Central Office
representatives who coordinated field operations.  Several field tests 
were undertaken to investigate a set of potential changes to the
survey and to the field operations.  Deborah Harshaw, Theresa Gordon,
Elizabeth Loudermilk, Dave Herr, Kathy Cossia, Bob Blessing, and
Marijo Gosselink were the interviewers who executed the pretests
of the revised pension questions in the 2004 SCF.  A second test,
which explored the possibility of separating the interviewers'
responsibilty to gain respondents' cooperation and their
responsibility to conduct the interview, was undertaken by
Deborah Harshaw, Carol Kasdorf, Susan Miller and Nancy Mutz.
Kathleen Goodell, Theresa Gordon, Judith Ruskin, Kathleen Sullivan,
and Shirley Tipton were the interviewers for the main pretest.
The Field Project Managers for the study were Tracy Buie, Julie
Feldman and Sandy Pitzer.  The Field Managers were 
Anne Anderson, Patricia Bass, Colleen Foster, Patricia Gilley,
Sally Harrison, Ella Kemp, Wanda Mallison (filling in temporarily for
Nina Walker) Connie Miller, Susan Miller, Nancy Mutz, Debra Schaefer,
Nina Walker and Mary Zavotsky.  The interviewers for the main field
work, some of whom may prefer not to be named, are always the people
who do the hardest work.  In 2004, the field team included many
experienced interviewers--some who had worked on earlier SCFs--and
others from a wide variety of backgrounds.  They deserve the deep
gratitude of users of the SCF data.  I humbly apologize to many
other colleagues in the Central Office and in the field who worked on
the 2004 SCF and whose names do not appear here.

The largest debt is owed to the survey respondents, who are
necessarily anonymous.  May every user of the data remember that some
person gave his or her time in the public interest to create the data
that make their analysis possible.

No set of acknowledgements would be complete without mentioning three
people: Fritz Scheuren, who provided early and continuing
encouragement, insights, and support for the SCF project; Robert
Avery, my predecessor as director of the SCF, is a colleague who not
only created the atmosphere that made the current development of the
project possible, but who continues to contribute as a sounding board
for our ideas; and Dorothy S. Projector, the project director of the
Federal Reserve's landmark 1962-63 Survey of Financial Characteristics
of Consumers, set a very high standard for all future work on
household wealth surveys.

X42001    Revised Kennickell-Woodburn consistent weight: accounts for
          systemative deviations from CPS estimates of homeownership
          by racial/ethnic Groups.  This weight should be used for all
          estimations using the final 2004 SCF data for which weights
          are appropriate.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
REPLICATE WEIGHTS AND MULTIPLICITY FACTORS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As noted in the introduction, there is one additional data file
which contains replicate weights and multiplicity factors to be used in
estimating sampling variances.  The file corresponds to the main
weight X42001.

The replicate weights are of the form WT1Bi, where i=1,...999
The multiplicity factors are of the form MMi, where i=1,...999

Replicate weights with a given index correspond to multiplicity
factors with the same index.

           useful answer is always an exact amount that truly reflects
	   your situation.  However, this is not always possible--you
	   may not know the figure, or you may not feel comfortable
           answering.  Because your answers are so important to the
           study, I am allowed to collect dollar ranges when no better
	   information is available.  Of course, if there is a
           question you cannot answer or do not want to answer, we
           will move on at that point.  Feel free to consult any
           knowledgeable person or use any records and notes at any
           time during this interview.

           HAND THE INSTITUTIONS CARD TO THE RESPONDENT AND SAY:  As
           we go through the interview, I will ask you to write a few
           things on this card to help keep us on track.  At the end
           of the interview, I will either leave this card with you or
           tear it up, whichever you prefer.


X8000      Original respondent and spouse/partner variables reversed.

           THE PERSON REFERRED TO AS THE "HEAD" IN THIS CODEBOOK IS
           EITHER THE MALE IN A MIXED-SEX COUPLE OR THE OLDER
           INDIVIDUAL IN A SAME-SEX COUPLE.  WHERE X8000=1, ALL
           VARIABLES IN THE DATA SET THAT ORIGINALLY REFERRED TO
           "RESPONDENT" AND "SPOUSE/PARTNER" AND ALL CODES THAT
           CONTAIN THE SAME REFERENCES HAVE BEEN REVERSED.  THIS
           CHANGE IS MADE FOR CONVENIENCE IN PROCESSING THE DATA AND
           INDICATES NO JUDGMENT WHATSOEVER ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENTS OF
           INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES.  THE QUESTION TEXT AND ASSOCIATED
           CODES GIVEN HERE HAVE NOT BEEN ALTERED TO USE THE WORD
           "HEAD."  NO CHANGE IS MADE WHERE THE SPOUSE/PARTNER IS
           NOT INCLUDED IN THE INTERVIEW (X100=5).

           In the 2004 SCF, the definitions used in determining
           whether a spouse or partner is a part of the primary
           economic unit changed somewhat from earlier SCFs.  Most of
           these changes affect small groups of the population.  Two
           groups account for most of the changes.  First, cases where
           the respondent intially reports being married, but the
           spouse is not there (or it is questionable whether the
           spouse is there) and does not share in the finances of the
           unit (or it is questionable whether the spouse does so).
           The second group is a roughly comparable group of partners.
           Where respondents have not been willing to answer questions
           about the presence of spouses or partner, default
           assumptions were made.

X7019      The following variable summarizes the sets of possible martial
           arrangements and specifies the assumption about whether a
           spouse or partner is included in the primary economic unit.
           The information used in this classification is based on the
           answers of the original respondent; when X8000=5, this
           information is contained in the first position of the
           household listing variables below, and when X8000=1 the
           information in the second position was used.
           Note that unlike the case with other variables in the main
           interview, variables in the initial household listing
           describing the respondent's marital status are not imputed.

            cases, an assumption is made and that assumption is
            contained in X7020; the determination of X7001 relies on
            the assumption in X7020.

X305       The next few questions are about the financial
           institutions where you do business.

           With how many financial institutions do you currently have
           accounts or loans, or regularly do personal financial
           business?  Include banks, savings and loans, credit unions,
           brokerages, loan companies, and so forth, but not
           institutions where you have only credit cards or business
           accounts.

           With how many financial institutions do you and your family
           living here currently have accounts or loans, or regularly
           do personal financial business?  Include banks, savings and
           loans, credit unions, brokerages, loan companies, and so
           forth, but not institutions where you have only credit
           cards or business accounts.

X8300      Inferred number of institutions.  When institutions were
           reported (or in some cases, imputed) after the institution
           data were collected (except in the case of bank-type credit
           cards) the CAPI program returned to the institution
           questions for the added institutions.  In some cases,
           interviewers failed to enter the new instituion properly,
           so the followup questions were not generated by the CAPI
           program.  X8300 takes the originally reported value of X305
           as its base and adds additional institutions whenever a
           commercial bank, savings and loan, credit union, or
           brokerage was reported without an initial link to the
           institution data.  Where more there were more than the 6
           institutions on which detailed information was collected,
           the total number of institutions was augmented and stored
           in X8300.  In cases where any of the first seven institutions
           have been inferred from an interviewer error, the detailed
           information (location and how R does business) has been
           imputed.

           Code NUMBER
           -1.  NONE


           Institutions were enumerated by name, and the name was used
           as a text fill later in the interview when, e.g., the R was
           asked to identify the institution where the main checking
           account was held.  To protect the privacy of respondents,
           this variable was not retained in the data set.

           (What is the name of this financial institution?/
           What is the name of the financial institution where you do
           the most business?/What is the name of the financial
           institution where you and your family living here do the
           most business?)

           [What is the name of the financial institution where you do
           the  (second/third/fourth/fifth/sixth/seventh) most business?/
           What is the name of the financial institution where you and
           your family living here do the (second/third/fourth/fifth/
	   sixth/seventh) most business?

	   IF R ASKS WHY WE NEED THE NAME, SAY:  I only need to put
	   the name in the computer for the wording of some questions
	   later in the interview.  Please feel free to call it
	   anything you like that you will recognize when we come to
	   it again.

           Once the program had generated questions about the number
           of institutions specified by X305, the program asked:

           Do you have any other financial institutions which we have not
           listed yet?
           (Have you included all your accounts?/Have you included the
           accounts for all the people in your household?)

           If the R recalled an additional account, the program was
           set up to augment the list of institutions until the
           respondent said there were no more.

           If X305 contained a value that indicated that there were
           accounts, but the number was a missing value, the R was
           asked:

           NOTE: CARD 3 was available to the interviewer.  This card
           contains the following in a vertical column: "Commercial
           Bank," "Savings and Loan or Savings Bank," "Credit Union,"
           "Finance or Loan Company," "Brokerage," and "Other."

           NOTE: Throughout the codebook, there are variable which
           are labeled "Recode: type of institution".  In these
           locations, the preceding question asks the respondent
           whether the institution where a loan/account is held is
           the same as one of the ones originally recorded in the
           sequence here.  If it was one of these, the interviewer
           entered a link to the appropriate institution.  If it was a
           new institution and there were fewer than seven institutions
           already listed, the interviewer was instructed to follow a
           procedure to add the institution to the existing list of
           institutions.  Once seven institutions were recorded in the
           list, the interviewer could either link to an institution
           that had already been recorded or code an institution type
           (e.g., commercial bank).  For the cases where a link was
           made to one of the listed institutions, the recode
           variable contains a code for the institution type obtained
           from matching to the sequence of variables described here.
           Where the institution was one that was outside the scope of
           the list, the recode variable contains a code for the
           institution type as asked directly from the respondent.

           NOTE: Examination of the data suggests that a relatively
           small number of respondents reported that their mortgage
           institution was a finance company and some others reported
           that it was a brokerage.  Examination of the name of the
           institution, which is available for most cases in a
           non-public internal data set, suggests that the respondent
           misclassified a mortgage company or mortgage broker.

IRA/KEOGH ACCOUNTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
X3601      As we continue through the interview, I will be asking you 
           about several types of retirement assets you may have, such 
           as Keoghs, IRAs or "Individual Retirement Accounts,"
	   annuities, and pensions and retirement accounts you may
	   have through a current or past job.

           Here I would like to ask just about IRAs and Keogh
           accounts.  These may include accounts that you "rolled
           over" into an IRA after leaving a previous job as well as
           Roth IRAs, or any other type of IRA or Keogh account that
           is not part of a retirement plan on a current or past job.
           Please do not include IRA-SEP or IRA-SIMPLE accounts, which
           we treat as job pensions.

           Do you (or anyone in your family living here) have any
           Keoghs or IRAs?

	   "EDUCATION IRAs" ARE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.

If R reported that R/SP/OFM had an IRA (X3602=1/X3612=1/X3622=1) , but
answered DK/REF to type, the CAPI program asked the balance in all of
the accounts.  As in the cases where R broke off before completing a

the individual components.

           Do you or anyone in your family living here have any life
           insurance?  Please include individual and group policies,
           but not accident insurance.

X4002      The two major types of life insurance are term and
           cash-value policies.  Term policies pay a benefit if the
           insured person dies, but otherwise have no value.  They are
           often provided through an employer or union, but may also
           be bought by individuals.  Cash-value policies also pay a
           death benefit, but differ in that they build up a value as
           premiums are paid.  Other names for types of cash value
           policies are "whole life" and "universal life."

           Are any of your policies individual term insurance?

If R reported having life insurance (X4001=1), but reports no term
insurance (X4002=5) and no whole life insurance (X4004=5), then the

insurance.  R might also have reported having term insurance, DK
whether other insurance is whole life but still know the face value or
the remaining insurance.  If an amount was provided, it was used as a
constraint on the imputation of the sum of the face value of term and

           For each occupation group, regressions were run separately
           for males and females of the log of annualized wages on a
           constant, a spline on age (AGE, MAX(0, AGE-35),
           MAX(0,AGE-55)), a dummy variable for part-time employment
           (1 = working fewer than 20 hours per week), a dummy variable
           for self-employment (1 = self-employed), a dummy for race
           (1 = Hispanic or non-white), and dummy variables for years
           of education (1 = : 12 years of education, some college or
           an Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, higher degree
           than Bachelor's degree).  If there were too few people in a CPS
           3-digit occupation group, either the SCF case was matched to
           a neighboring occupation group, or the match was made at the
           level of the 2-digit occupation code.  Some of the model
           coefficients may be identically zero where there are too few
           cases in the appropriate cells in the CPS data to identify
           these coefficients; for example, a coefficient for the
           [36,55) element of the age spline may be identically zero
           if there are no CPS cases in that age group for the given
           occupation.

X11000(#1a) There are two general types of pension plans.
X11100(#1b)
X11200(#1c) In one type, a worker is entitled to receive regular
X11300(#2a) retirement payments for as long as the worker lives, which
X11400(#2b) are most often determined by a formula as a percentage of
X11500(#2c) final or average pay.

            In the other type of plan, money accumulates in an account
            designated for a worker, and that money may be paid out in
            a variety of ways depending on the plan or the worker's
            choice.

            Some plans may be like both of these types.

            of [your/his/her] pension plans)?  (Is it the type that
            gives regular retirement payments, is it the type that
            accumulates an account balance, or is it like both?)

INFORMATION LINKED FROM 2004 CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY BY OCCUPATION CODE

X8171(#1)  Recode: Unconditional mean wage for occupation group in 2004
X8172(#2)
           Code number
           0.  Inap. (/no spouse; no 3-digit occupation code for past
               job: X7405=0 and X7407=0 and X7409=0/X7415=0 and

           *********************************************************

           For each occupation group, regressions were run separately
           for males and females of the log of annualized wages on a
           constant, a spline on age (AGE, MAX(0, AGE-35),
           MAX(0,AGE-55)), a dummy variable for part-time employment
           (1 = working 20 or fewer hours per week), a dummy variable
           for self-employment (1 = self-employed), a dummy for race
           (1 = Hispanic or non-white), and dummy variables for years
           of education (1 = : 12 years of education, some college or
           an Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, higher degree
           than Bachelor's degree).  If there were too few people in a CPS
           3-digit occupation group, either the SCF case was matched to
           a neighboring occupation group, or the match was made at the
           level of the 2-digit occupation code.  Some of the model
           coefficients may be identically zero where there are too few
           cases in the appropriate cells in the CPS data to identify
           these coefficients; for example, a coefficient for the
           [36,55) element of the age spline may be identically zero
           if there are no CPS cases in that age group for the given
           occupation.

X7650      Is this income unusually high or low compared to what you
           would expect in a "normal" year, or is it normal?

            1.  *High
            2.  *Low
            3.  *Normal

           NOTE: some respondents reported that their 2003 income was
           unusually high (low), but gave a normal income figure at
           X7362 that was higher (lower).  These cases appear to be
           ones where the frame of reference for "normal" has shifted:
           e.g., a student made an unusually large amount last year as
           a student, but in a full-time job now makes more.


           Why is that?

           The following variables relate to the structure of the
           banking markets in which the respondent lives.  These
           variables come from files maintained by the Financial
           Structure Section.  This information is matched to the
           survey data at the level of the MSA where possible, or at
           the county level otherwise.

INTERVIEWER REMARKS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The data in this section were obtained in two ways.  First, some
of the data derive from the "household enumeration folder" (HEF) a
largely administrative paper document used by interviewers to select
the designated respondent, to update the area-probability sample, to
record recontact information, and to record information about
non-interviews.  Additional data were collected in the HEF on the
neighborhood in which the respondent lived and on characteristics of
the respondent.  Second, other variables (X6523, X6525, X6526, X6527,
X6528, X6529, X6530, X6531, X6532, X6533, X6534, X6535, X6536, X6724,
X6725, X6726, X6727, X6728, X6729, and X7504) were originally recorded
in "Section ZZ," a separate CAPI program used by interviewers after
the main interview to record the varibles along with other information
about the interview that might be relevant to the data editing.
Not all of the variables collected are described in this section;
only variables similar to those reported in earlier SCFs are included
here.

/ Hay dos tipos principales de seguro de vida, la pliza de seguro a trmino (term policy) y la pliza que acumula un valor monetario (cash-value policy). Las plizas de seguro de vida a termino, pagan un beneficio si muere la persona asegurada, de otra manera no tiene ningn valor.  Estas plizas las ofrece a menudo un empleador o sindicato, pero tambin individuos pueden comprarlas directamente.  La pliza que acumula un valor monetario tambin paga un beneficio a la muerte del asegurado, pero se diferencia de la otra en que esta acumula y aumenta su valor cuando se pagan las primas. A estas plizas que acumulan un valor monetario tambin se les llama "whole life" y "universal life."

/ Hay dos tipos generales de planes de pensin.
/
/ En un tipo, el trabajador tiene el derecho de recibir pagos regulares de
/ jubilacin por el resto de su vida.  Los cules son frecuentemente
/ determinados por una formula como un porcentaje del pago final o promedio.
/
/ En el otro tipo de plan, el dinero se acumula en una cuenta asignada al
/ trabajador y ese dinero se puede pagar de varias formas dependiendo del
/ plan o del deseo del trabajador.
/
/ Algunos planes pueden ser como ambos de estos planes.
