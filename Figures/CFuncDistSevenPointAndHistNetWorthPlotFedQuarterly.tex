\footnotesize Notes: The solid curve shows the consumption function
for $\Discount$-Point model with KS aggregate process in the good
aggregate state.  The dashed curves show the consumption functions
for the most patient and the least patient consumers for
$\Discount$-Dist model with KS aggregate process in the good
aggregate state. The histogram shows the empirical distribution of
net worth ($\mRat_{t}$) in the Survey of Consumer Finances of 2004.
