  abstract =      {The wealthy hand-to-mouth are households who hold
                   little or no liquid wealth (e.g. cash, checking, and
                   saving accounts), despite owning sizable amounts of
                   illiquid assets (i.e., assets that carry a
                   transaction cost, such as housing, large durables, or
                   retirement accounts). This portfolio configuration
                   implies that these households have large marginal
                   propensities to consume out of small income changes
                   â€“a key determinant of the macroeconomic
                   effects of fiscal policy. The wealthy hand-to-mouth,
                   therefore, behave in many respects like households
                   with little or no net worth, yet they escape standard
                   definitions (and empirical measurements) of
                   hand-to-mouth agents based on net worth. We use
                   survey data on household portfolios for the U.S.,
                   Canada, Australia, the U.K., Germany, France, Italy,
                   and Spain to document the share of such households
                   across countries, their demographic characteristics,
                   the composition of their balance sheet, and the
                   persistence of hand-to-mouth status over the life
                   cycle. Finally, we discuss the implications of this
                   group of consumers for macroeconomic modelling and
                   policy analysis.},
