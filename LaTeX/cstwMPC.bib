  volume =        {Spring},

  abstract =      {Administrative tax data indicate that U.S. top income
                   and wealth shares are substantial and increasing
                   rapidly (Piketty and Saez 2003, Saez and Zucman
                   2014). A key reason for using administrative data to
                   measure top shares is to overcome the
                   under-representation of families at the very top that
                   plagues most household surveys. However, using tax
                   records alone restricts the unit of analysis for
                   measuring economic resources, limits the concepts of
                   income and wealth being measured, and imposes a rigid
                   correlation between income and wealth. The Survey of
                   Consumer Finances (SCF) solves the
                   under-representation problem by combining
                   administrative and survey data (Bricker et al, 2014).
                   Administrative records are used to select the SCF
                   sample and verify that high-end families are
                   appropriately represented, and the survey is designed
                   to measure comprehensive concepts of income and
                   wealth at the family level. The SCF shows high and
                   rising top income and wealth shares, as in the ad
                   ministrative tax data. However, unadjusted, the
                   levels and growth based on administrative tax data
                   alone appear to be substantially larger. By
                   constraining the SCF to be conceptually comparable,
                   we reconcile the differences, and show the extent to
                   which restrictions and rigidities needed to estimate
                   top income and wealth shares in the administrative
                   data bias up levels and growth rates.},

                   Evidence from Capitalized Income Tax Data},
  year =          {2016},
  abstract =      {This paper combines income tax returns with Flow of
                   Funds data to estimate the distribution of household
                   wealth in the United States since 1913. We estimate
                   wealth by capitalizing the incomes reported by
                   individual taxpayers, accounting for assets that do
                   not generate taxable income. We successfully test our
                   capitalization method in three micro datasets where
                   we can observe both income and wealth: the Survey of
                   Consumer Finance, linked estate and income tax
                   returns, and foundations' tax records. Wealth
                   concentration has followed a U-shaped evolution over
                   the last 100 years: It was high in the beginning of
                   the twentieth century, fell from 1929 to 1978, and
                   has continuously increased since then. The rise of
                   wealth inequality is almost entirely due to the rise
                   of the top 0.1\% wealth share, from 7\% in 1979 to
                   22\% in 2012--a level almost as high as in 1929. The
                   bottom 90\% wealth share first increased up to the
                   mid-1980s and then steadily declined. The increase in
                   wealth concentration is due to the surge of top
                   incomes combined with an increase in saving rate
                   inequality. Top wealth-holders are younger today than
                   in the 1960s and earn a higher fraction of total
                   labor income in the economy. We explain how our
                   findings can be reconciled with Survey of Consumer
                   Finances and estate tax data.},

                   Confronts the Six Headwinds},
  year =          {2012},
  abstract =      {This paper raises basic questions about the process
                   of economic growth. It questions the assumption,
                   nearly universal since Solow's seminal contributions
                   of the 1950s, that economic growth is a continuous
                   process that will persist forever. There was
                   virtually no growth before 1750, and thus there is no
                   guarantee that growth will continue indefinitely.
                   Rather, the paper suggests that the rapid progress
                   made over the past 250 years could well turn out to
                   be a unique episode in human history. The paper is
                   only about the United States and views the future
                   from 2007 while pretending that the financial crisis
                   did not happen. Its point of departure is growth in
                   per-capita real GDP in the frontier country since
                   1300, the U.K. until 1906 and the U.S. afterwards.
                   Growth in this frontier gradually accelerated after
                   1750, reached a peak in the middle of the 20th
                   century, and has been slowing down since. The paper
                   is about "how much further could the frontier growth
                   rate decline?" The analysis links periods of slow and
                   rapid growth to the timing of the three industrial
                   revolutions (IR's), that is, IR #1 (steam, railroads)
                   from 1750 to 1830; IR #2 (electricity, internal
                   combustion engine, running water, indoor toilets,
                   communications, entertainment, chemicals, petroleum)
                   from 1870 to 1900; and IR #3 (computers, the web,
                   mobile phones) from 1960 to present. It provides
                   evidence that IR #2 was more important than the
                   others and was largely responsible for 80 years of
                   relatively rapid productivity growth between 1890 and
                   1972. Once the spin-off inventions from IR #2
                   (airplanes, air conditioning, interstate highways)
                   had run their course, productivity growth during
                   1972-96 was much slower than before. In contrast, IR
                   #3 created only a short-lived growth revival between
                   1996 and 2004. Many of the original and spin-off
                   inventions of IR #2 could happen only once -
                   urbanization, transportation speed, the freedom of
                   females from the drudgery of carrying tons of water
                   per year, and the role of central heating and air
                   conditioning in achieving a year-round constant
                   temperature. Even if innovation were to continue into
                   the future at the rate of the two decades before
                   2007, the U.S. faces six headwinds that are in the
                   process of dragging long-term growth to half or less
                   of the 1.9 percent annual rate experienced between
                   1860 and 2007. These include demography, education,
                   inequality, globalization, energy/environment, and
                   the overhang of consumer and government debt. A
                   provocative "exercise in subtraction" suggests that
                   future growth in consumption per capita for the
                   bottom 99 percent of the income distribution could
                   fall below 0.5 percent per year for an extended
                   period of decades.},

  abstract =      {Only one-fifth of respondents to a rider on the
                   University of Michigan Survey Research Center's
                   Monthly Survey said that the 2008 tax rebates would
                   lead them to mostly increase spending. Almost half
                   said the rebate would mostly lead them to pay off
                   debt, while about a third saying it would lead them
                   mostly to save more. The survey responses imply that
                   the aggregate propensity to spend from the rebate was
                   about one-third, and that there would not be
                   substantially more spending as a lagged effect of the
                   rebates. Because of the low spending propensity, the
                   rebates in 2008 provided low \&quot;bang for the
                   buck\&quot; as economic stimulus. Putting cash into
                   the hands of the consumers who use it to save or pay
                   off debt boosts their well-being, but it does not
                   necessarily make them spend. Low-income individuals
                   were particularly likely to use the rebate to pay off
                   debt.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another

                   derive analytical expressions for the dynamics of
                   consumption, hours, and earnings of two earners in
                   the presence of correlated wage shocks,
                   nonseparability, progressive taxation, and asset
                   accumulation. The model is estimated using panel data
                   for hours, earnings, assets, and consumption. We
                   focus on family labor supply as an insurance
                   mechanism and find strong evidence of smoothing of
                   permanent wage shocks. Once family labor supply,

                   asymptotic distributions in these nonstandard

                   of functional central limit theory. The quality of

  abstract =      {The wealthy hand-to-mouth are households who hold
                   little or no liquid wealth (e.g. cash, checking, and
                   saving accounts), despite owning sizable amounts of
                   illiquid assets (i.e., assets that carry a
                   transaction cost, such as housing, large durables, or
                   retirement accounts). This portfolio configuration
                   implies that these households have large marginal
                   propensities to consume out of small income changes
                   â€“a key determinant of the macroeconomic
                   effects of fiscal policy. The wealthy hand-to-mouth,
                   therefore, behave in many respects like households
                   with little or no net worth, yet they escape standard
                   definitions (and empirical measurements) of
                   hand-to-mouth agents based on net worth. We use
                   survey data on household portfolios for the U.S.,
                   Canada, Australia, the U.K., Germany, France, Italy,
                   and Spain to document the share of such households
                   across countries, their demographic characteristics,
                   the composition of their balance sheet, and the
                   persistence of hand-to-mouth status over the life
                   cycle. Finally, we discuss the implications of this
                   group of consumers for macroeconomic modelling and
                   policy analysis.},

  abstract =      {This paper studies the cyclical nature of individual
                   income risk using a confidential dataset from the
                   U.S. Social Security Administration, which contains
                   (uncapped) earnings histories for millions of
                   individuals. The base sample is a nationally
                   representative panel containing 10 percent of all
                   U.S. males from 1978 to 2010. We use these data to
                   decompose individual income growth during recessions
                   into “between-group” and “within-group”
                   components. We begin with the behavior of
                   within-group shocks. Contrary to past research, we do
                   not find the variance of idiosyncratic income shocks
                   to be countercyclical. Instead, it is the
                   left-skewness of shocks that is strongly
                   countercyclical. That is, during recessions, the
                   upper end of the shock distribution collapses—large
                   upward income movements become less likely—whereas
                   the bottom end expands—large drops in income become
                   more likely. Thus, while the dispersion of shocks
                   does not increase, shocks become more left skewed
                   and, hence, risky during recessions. Second, to study
                   between-group differences, we group individuals based
                   on several observable characteristics at the time a
                   recession hits. One of these characteristics—the
                   average income of an individual at the beginning of a
                   business cycle episode—proves to be an especially
                   good predictor of fortunes during a recession:
                   prime-age workers that enter a recession with high
                   average earnings suffer substantially less compared
                   with those who enter with low average earnings (which
                   is not the case during expansions). Finally, we find
                   that the cyclical nature of income risk is
                   dramatically different for the top 1 percent compared
                   with all other individuals—even relative to those
                   in the top 2 to 5 percent.},
